Set spectrum analyser to 0 dbm 100kHz and plug directly into digital board.

test system results:
All bit counts roughly equal.
Vrms according to multimeter was 221(+/-1) mV
raw_data_test data had min of around -11k and max around +11k and rms of 7800 giving a voltage cutoff of +/-0.93 V.
0.221/(7800/2**15) = 0.93 V
